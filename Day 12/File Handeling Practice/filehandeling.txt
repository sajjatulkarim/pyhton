File handeling is method to access over context in existing file or it will create a context to extract data or do some functionality
We are dealing with 3 mode for modifying the context we are working on.They are-
1. Write mode
2. Read mode
3. Append mode
Write mode is deal with write something into a defined location.
If we dont have any existing file where we can write context so before that we can create it.
Syntext: (Basic)- Context(variable name) = file name then mode name.Call write function
Enter the context
close the file by calling a defined function close()
